<body>
<h1>Top level Heading</h1>
<h2>Sub-heading</h2>
<p>A paragraph</p>

<ol> <!-- Ordered Bullet list -->
<li>Item One
<li>Item two -- do note that you do not need to keep count yourself.
</ol>

Some random text containing <i>italics</i> and <b>bold text</b>. 

Your browser will mostly remove empty lines and       extra    spaces,
and make all of this (including what comes below), into one long
running paragraph.

<a href="/buy/heartstopperBurger">A clickable link</a> (Please look at the URL and think about where it goes)
<a href="https://zombo.com/">A link to some other web page</a>

You can also insert images into the text: <img src="/images/flower.png">

Your web browser will try to fetch this image from the same server using the given URI,
so you need to make sure that your web server knows what to do with the uri /images/flower.png .

<p>A small paragraph just to end matters.</p>
