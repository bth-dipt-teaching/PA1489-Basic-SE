* Introduction
- Different types of User Interfaces
  - Text
  - Graphics
  - Files
  - Network/Web (mostly next lecture)
* Different Interfaces
Swedish: /Gränssnitt/

- Components offer a /programming interface/  
  - API :: Application Programming Interface
  - classes and functions
  - Used by /programmers/ to access and use the component
- Classes offer a /public interface/
  - Public methods and attributes that are available on all objects

A program has other interfaces
- /User Interface/ with which users can access and interact with the application
- /File formats/ that the program understand how to read and write
- /Network interfaces/ that the program provides
  - HTTP/HTML is one particular type of network interface
* User Interfaces
A User Interface (UI) can be more or less advanced:
1. Command Line Parameters
2. Printouts in a terminal
3. Input/output to a terminal
4. /TUI/ - Text-based User Interface
5. /GUI/ - Graphical User Interface
* Text-based User Interfaces
- Most unix-commands accept parameters and output text
  - e.g. ~ls -al~, ~curl https://www.zombo.com~
- Some start an interactive enviromment
  - e.g. ~python~, ~gdb~
- Some create a text based UI
  - e.g. ~mc~, ~vi , or ~emacs -nw~

Advantages:
- Always work
- Always work even when run remotely (e.g. via ~ssh~)
- Always work even when the window enviromment does not start

Disadvantages:
- More difficult to discover and learn how they work
- More difficult to construct such that they are simple to use
- Can only show a limited amount of information at the time (80x25 characters)
* Graphical User Interfaces
- Regular desktop applications
- Familiar to most users
- Can be arbitrarily complex or (hopefully) simple

- Built with the help of different frameworks
  - e.g. Qt, Gnome, Java Swing/Java AWT
  - (Also as locally running web applications, e.g. /Electron/)

#+RESULTS:

* One application - several interfaces
The same application may have many interfaces
- May have several GUIs for different types of users
- May have a text-based UI for power users
- May accept command line parameters
- May be accessible over a network connection
- Will probably read and write specific file formats
* Swappable UI's
- UI code should be located in separate components/classes/files:
  - GUI / TUI -code
  - input/output code
  - parameter parsing
- Separate /Logic/ from /Presentation/
- Cleaner software design -- easier to maintain

Sometimes a "pretty" UI uses a "simpler" UI underneath (called a /porcelain/)
- Your development environment uses command line tools but hides it from you.
- for examle: ~git~, ~python~, ~gdb~, \dots
- /You can replace the pretty UI and keep the logic/
* Text Input/Output
- Mostly built-in in most programming languages
  - Python: ~print~, ~input~
  - Java: ~System.out.println()~, ~System.console().readLine()~
  - C++: ~cout~ and ~cin~
  - C: ~printf()~, and ~scanf()~
  - Node.js/JavaScript: ~console.log()~, but no easy input function

#+begin_src python
print('How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck would chuch wood?')

amount = input()
wouldit = input('If a woodchuck would chuck wood, would a woodchuck chuck wood?')

print(amount, wouldit)
#+end_src
* Graphical User Interface Frameworks
- Builtin for Java, but commonly you need separate packages
- Python: PyQt, PySide, Tkinter, Kivy, \dots
  - Mostly recommended: ~PyQt6~ or ~PySide6~ (different licenses)
  - Both use =Qt=: https://www.qt.io/product/framework
  - Sometimes builtin: ~Tkinter~

Key concepts:
- A /Widget/ is something you want to show (window, button, \dots )
  - Widgets are often recursively composable.
- An /Event/ is some user interaction (push a button, press a key, \dots )
- The /Event Loop/ is handled internally by the GUI framework
  1. Wait for an event
  2. Act on the event (call a function)
  3. Goto (1)
* PySide (or PyQt)
- Many widgets: https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/overviews/qtwidgets-widget-classes.html#widgets-classes
- Inherit ~QMainWindow~ to create your own window.
- Widgets emit /Signals/
  - The documentation lists the signals a specific widget may emit
  - You may need to look at its superclasses to see all possible signals.
- You provide a function to receive a signal, called a /slot/


#+begin_src python
from PySide6.QtWidgets import QMainWindow, QApplication, QPushButton
import sys

class MainWindow(QMainWindow):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.setWindowTitle("Hello World")
        button = QPushButton("My simple app.")

        # on the object "button"
        # with the signal "clicked" (or pressed, released, or toggled)
        # connect the slot "self.button_clicked"
        button.clicked.connect(self.button_clicked)
        
        self.setCentralWidget(button)
        self.show()

    def button_clicked(self):
        print('Button was clicked')
        self.close()

app = QApplication(sys.argv)
w = MainWindow()
app.exec()
#+end_src
* Add more stuff
1. Create a ~Layout~ object
   - =QBoxLayout=, =QHBoxLayout=, =QVBoxLayout=, =QFormLayout=, =QGridLayout=, \dots
2. Add Widgets to this layout object
3. Create a container of the type ~QWidget~
4. Give the layout object to this container
5. Add the container to the ~MainWindow~

#+begin_src python
        edit = QLineEdit("write something here")
        label = QLabel("some text here")

        layout = QVBoxLayout()
        layout.addWidget(edit)
        layout.addWidget(label)

        container = QWidget()
        container.setLayout(layout)
        self.setCentralWidget(container)
#+end_src

*Note*:
- As you make increasingly complex user interfaces, this ~init~ method is going to get very long and intricate.
  - *Break it up* into smaller functions.
  - Think about logical divisions in your UI, have at least one method to initiate each of them.
- If you want to reach a widget later (e.g. to update its contents), you need to save a reference to it (e.g. ~self.editBox=QLineEdit()~)
* Use a GUI Builder
- Tools for building GUIs
- Drag and drop, connect signals to slots, write the code & go
- Examples
  - Qt Designer: https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/install-qt-designer-standalone/
  - Qt Creator && Qt Design Studio: https://www.qt.io/product/development-tools
  - Android Studio: https://developer.android.com/studio/install
  - You /may/ also have some GUI builder in your IDE -- or as an extension.

I prefer to "program" my UIs as above
  - less focus on pixel-perfect alignment -- trust the layout managers to do a good enough job.
  - more control over where & how references to widgets are stored and connected
  - no context-switching 
    - e.g. "I need a new button":
      1. write the slot function to receive events
      2. switch to GUI builder, add button, connect the right signals to the slot
      3. switch back to editor and continue coding.
      4. Realise you made a mistake, go back to GUI builder; rinse, repeat.
  - easier to generate repeated elements (e.g. with a =for=-loop )
  - - You /can/ program your user intefaces like above
  - \dots I am also an old bear who doesn't like to learn new tricks.
* When Things Go Wrong: Testing for Runtime Errors
- Compile-time errors:
  - Syntax Errors
    - the compiler tells you what you have written wrong
    - Read the compiler errors
  - Logical Errors
    - the compiler does not know this is wrong
    - Use Unit Testing to capture this.
    - Debugger

- Runtime errors :
  - Input Testing
    - Ensure that user enters "correct" information
  - Exception handling
    - runtime exceptions
    - e.g. "file not found", "divide by zero", \dots
* Handling Runtime Errors
- Handling compile-time errors is done during development
- Handling errors caught by automated tests is done during development
- Handling runtime errors /have to be/ handled during runtime!
* Detecting the Error
- Defensive Programming
  - Balance between checking everything and put reasonable trust in the program.

- Anticipating and avoiding the error 
- Detecting the error state
- Deciding what to do about the error
- Deciding how much to report to the user
* A Brief Word on Input Sanitisation
- Never ever /ever/ assume that input is correct
  - User input
  - Command line parameters
  - File contents
  - Socket traffic
  - Fetched data (e.g., html, xml, json)
  - HTTP header
  - Properties/Config files
  - \dots
  - https://github.com/kuronpawel/big-list-of-naughty-strings
  - https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/

- Java is safer than C++, but can still be really dangerous.
  - What do you do with the input?
    - Pass it on as a field to the database?
    - Display it in a web browser?
    - Use it as a script and interpret it?
  - Currently in Python: =t-strings= instead of =f-strings=
  - What do you do if not all data is present?
  - What do you do if the data is of the wrong type?

* Method Input: Parameters
- Are the parameters to a method within bounds?
- Are the parameters not null?
  - Are there good defaults to use instead?
- Will the method complete even with incorrect parameters?
- Will the result be meaningful?
* Error Reporting (to the user)
- Is the error quietly fixable?
- Should the user be /informed/ , or /warned/
- Should the program /exit/?
- Write to a log to facilitate debugging

#+begin_src java :imports java.util.logging.*
  int x = 10;
  Logger l = Logger.getLogger("se.bth.example.system.Test");
  l.entering("Main","main()");

  l.setLevel(Level.ALL);
  l.info("Current log level " + l.getLevel());

  l.config("Using default configuration");
  l.info("Starting...");

  l.log(Level.FINE, "Still here...");
  l.fine("Also still here");

  l.warning("Not sure how to proceed here");

  l.exiting("Main", "main()");
#+end_src
* Error Reporting (within program)
- Magic return value that indicates error
  - ~null~
  - ~-1~
  - ~false~
- Throw an Exception (Will it be caught ⁉️)
- Set an error flag somehwere
- \dots
* Error Handling
- Check for magic error number
- Catch Exception
- Check error flags

- Deal with the error if possible
  - Maybe return some indication that there was an error
  - /Do not/ blame the user, e.g. "Your name contains an invalid character!" \to "We cannot process this character"
  - Log the error
- Maybe re-try the same operation
  - How many times?
  - Delay between each try?
- When all fails: re-throw exception

- *Always* clean up when you detect an error!
  - If you tried to open a file, try to close it
  - If you had an open database connection, close it
  - \dots
* Summary
- Different types of User Interaction
  - Startup parameters and printouts
  - Console input/output
  - Text-based UI
  - Graphical UI
  - Web applications (next lecture)

- Constructing a GUI:
  - Widgets containing other Widgets
  - \dots that emit /Signals/ when certain events occur.

- Keep UI Code separate
- Use a GUI builder if you prefer
- Never trust user input
